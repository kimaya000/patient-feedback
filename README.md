This is a demo front-end I developed for a patient feedback survey website where the said healthcare facility can sign in on our website, have access to our customized survey and simply upload the csv of their answers on the website to get a sample report of their customer's answers and a quick look into how the performance of various aspects of the facility is reviewed by their own patients.
The site has a back-end developed on django, but these files are solely the front-end i have designed. It is very basic and the login feature is a dummy feature for now and is just exisiting as a placeholder.
