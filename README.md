# Patient Feedback Survey Website

This repository contains the front-end of a Patient Feedback Survey Website. The goal of this project is to provide healthcare facilities with a platform where they can sign in, access customized surveys, and upload CSV files containing patient feedback. Upon uploading the feedback, users can receive a sample report that offers insights into the performance of various aspects of their facility as reviewed by their patients.

## Overview

The current front-end is a basic implementation designed to showcase the concept. The back-end of this project is developed using Django, while this repository focuses solely on the front-end components. Note that the login feature is currently a placeholder and does not perform actual authentication.

## Features

- **Custom Survey Access**: Healthcare facilities can access customized surveys tailored to their needs.
- **CSV Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing survey responses.
- **Sample Report**: A quick report is generated from the uploaded CSV, providing insights into patient feedback.
- **Basic Front-End**: A simple, intuitive interface for interacting with the platform.
